#### [Appointment Booking System (Java)](https://jonbutler8.github.io/AppointmentBookingSystem)
A GUI appointment booking system developed in Java using JavaFX. Development was performed in a three student team following Scrum methodology and using Kanban (Trello) to track progress, with me (Jon Butler) acting as scrum master. Our implementation was chosen as one among a handful that were demoed to other students at the end of the semester.

As this was a group project, not all the work is my own. Some of the main components I was responsible for were:
* User registration
* Business hours customisation
* Employee work times customisation
* Modifying services
* Setting employee service availability
